        A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. 
        higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services.
        Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms.
        Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement.
        In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.
